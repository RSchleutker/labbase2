    Attributes
    ----------
    id : int
        The internal ID of this plasmis. The ID is unique among ALL entities
        in the datbase.
    vector : str
        The vector that was used for cloning. Usually, cloning means
        transferring an insert into a specific vector. By giving both the
        vector and the insert the plasmid should be fully defined.
    constructed_by : str
        The token of the person(s) that constructed and created the plasmid.
    created : date
        The date the plasmid was first created. This usually corresponds to
        the day of ligation.
    description : str
        A precise definition of the plasmid: What is it and what is it for.
        You may also give further information on how the plasmid was made.
    reference : str
        If the plasmid is published or was used somewhere it is possible to
        enter the DOI here.
    insert : str
        The token of the insert. As explained for 'vector' a plasmid should be
        fully defined by the vector and the insert.
    preps : list of Preparation
        A list of all preps that were done of this plasmid.
    bacteria : list of Bacteria
        A list of bacterial stocks that carry this plasmid.
    features : list of Feature
        A list of all features that this plasmid has like ampicillin
        resistance etc.
    sequence : Seq
        The sequence of the plasmid. The sequence is only available if a
        plasmid filepath was uploaded for the plasmid. This plasmid filepath
        is then read out and the sequence returned as a biopython Seq object.
        This attribute is generated with the @property decorator and accordingly
        can not be set manually.
    risk : int
        The risk potential of this plasmid. It is determined as the highest
        risk of any feature. This attribute is generated with the @property
        decorator and accordingly can not be set manually.

    Notes
    -----
    As most other classes Plasmid inherits from Entity and therefor has three
    additional attributes: 'comments', 'files', and 'requests'. See 'Entity'
    for further explanations.
