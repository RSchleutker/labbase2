    Attributes
    ----------
    id : int
        The ID of the filepath for internal identification.
    user_id : int
        The id of the person that has uploaded the filepath.
    filename_internal : str
        The name of the file as it was used to save it to the filesystem.
    filename_exposed : str
        The original filename of the file or the filename provided by the user during
        upload.
    note : str
        A short note about the filepath.
    file_type : str
        The type of the file. This is used for proper mapping and setting up
        inheritance.
    timestamp_uploaded : DateTime
        The time at which the filepath was uploaded. Automatically set by the database.
    timestamp_edited : DateTime
        The time the file entry was last edited.

    Notes
    -----
    There can be different kinds of files (PDFs, images, plasmid files, etc.). Since
    these filepath types sometimes differ in the way they are shown on the website (
    especially images and PDFs) they are modelled through different child classes
    that inherit from this class. Inheritance is implemented as single-table
    inheritance, i.e., all children are represented by a single table/relation in the
    database. They are differentiated by the 'type' attribute.
